### Hei og velkommen!

💼 I am an App Innovation Specialist at Microsoft - guiding customers into speeding up the deployment of features and the deployment frequency.

🏆 Ask me about Agile, product-based work, engineering autonomy and trust, OKRs, and communities of practice.

🤓 I can deliver application architecture/design sessions in my sleep.
